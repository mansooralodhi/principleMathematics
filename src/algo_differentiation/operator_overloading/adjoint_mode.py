-   if variable is initialized as DualNumber with tangent 1,
    then derivative will be computed with respect to this variable.
-   in reverse-mode or adjoint-mode, we can make tangent 1 of
    more than one variable. in other words, we can compute
    derivative of a single output  w.r.t all input variables."
